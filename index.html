    <h2 class="h2">The Career of a Computer Programmer:</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="p">The job of computer programmer is one with many responsibilities because of the various components to programming; computer programmers must be able to code, test, fix and maintain computer programs so that computers can be properly instructed to perform functions and complete designated tasks. Computer programmers do this through the use of different programming languages, such as Java, C and C++.<p>
	  <p class="p">Generally, the required education for a computer programmer is the completion of a post-secondary program in computer science or another programming-related subject. This post-secondary education may come in the form of a bachelor’s degree in computer science or in the form or through the completion of a college program. Evidently, a high school diploma is also required to obtain either of these forms of post-secondary education.</p> 
	  <p class="p">Despite the recent high increase in graduates in related fields of study and the low rate of retirement to free job positions because it is a relatively new career, the future outlook for computer programmers is good. The reason why this is a good field to go into is that there is a low amount of students going into the field because of the perceived difficulty, and computers are constantly evolving and being used in more ways, meaning that more and more programmers will be sought after. In addition to this, In Canada, the median salary of computer programmers is $67, 509 a year, ranging from a low of $41, 389 to the potential salary of $96, 374 a year. This means that computer programmers are paid fairly well.</p>
	  <p class="p">Personally, I am not particularly interested in this career because I believe that going into computer science would be very difficult for me and I believe that I have much greater strengths in other areas; I believe that I would be much better-suited in other fields of science, rather than computer science. Despite that, the path of becoming a computer programmer or a related profession is one that fascinates me, so I still have some interest in the field and have not completely ruled it out as an option.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">Post-Secondary Education for an Aspiring Computer Programmer:</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="p">The University of Waterloo is an example of an institution that offers a university program for computer science. The school even has over 70 different computer science courses to choose from. The high school course requirement for computer science at this university are six grade 12 university (“U”) or mixed (“M”) credits, including advanced functions, calculus and vectors, any grade 12 “U” english, at least one more grade twelve “U” credit and it is strongly recommended for students to take grade 11 “U” introduction to computer science. Participation in the CSMC and Euclid math contests is also heavily encouraged. The admission average for computer science at the University of Waterloo is the low 90s.</p>
    <p class="p">To get a diploma for a bachelor’s degree in computer science, it should take four years. The first semester in the first year of the program would include designing functional programs, algebra, calculus 1, a communication skill course and an elective. The second semester courses would be algorithm design and data abstraction, linear algebra 1, calculus 2 and two electives.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Catechism and my Vocation</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="p">The career I have selected can help me fulfill the vocation God has called me to because as a computer programmer, I could create and maintain programs that help many people to accomplish tasks or find entertainment. This would be a way of sharing the image of God and doing things for the greater good of humanity because my work could be done to spread positivity and joy to others.</p>
    <p class="p">My vocation for this career will enable me to set appropriate goals in school because I am aware of the marks that I would require to enter this field of work. My vocation would also help me set goals at work because I would strive to improve and put forth the best work possible to meet my own satisfaction and to fulfill the needs of others. Finally, this vocation would also aid me in setting goals in my personal life because habits that I would have been forced to develop in other areas, such as constantly putting forth high amounts of effort at school, would carry over to my personal life.</p>
